# DXP Frontend Starter Kit

**Kick-start your composable web platform with an open-source frontend starter.**

This project provides a foundation for building digital experience platforms (DXPs) with **Next.js**, a **headless CMS**, and our **API integration layer**.  
Built on the Open Self Service (O2S) framework, it allows you to evolve from simple CMS-based websites into full-scale composable solutions by customizing the starter and integrating your chosen APIs.
